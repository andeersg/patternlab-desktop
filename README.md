# Pattern Lab Desktop

A small application that allows you to use Pattern Lab without using the command line.

It can only control grunt and gulp versions for now.

## Build steps

```
git clone https://github.com/andeersg/patternlab-desktop
cd patternlab-desktop
npm install
npm start
```

This project uses [Electron Forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge), so take a look at their documentation for creating releases (for now, until I am able to create them here).
